You are to design and develop "SmartFileGuardian", an AI-powered malware detection web application adhering strictly to the detailed product requirements. The system must enable real-time file and URL analysis, leveraging machine learning models for effective threat detection, and provide comprehensive quarantine and monitoring functionalities.

Key Requirements:

1. **File Analysis**
- Accept multiple file types including executables, PDFs, and archives.
- Perform real-time malware scanning using machine learning models (using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch).
- Provide detailed threat reports including risk scores.
- Support batch file uploads and scanning.

2. **URL Analysis**
- Accept URLs for threat analysis.
- Query public threat intelligence APIs (e.g., Google Safe Browsing, PhishTank) to check domain reputation.
- Detect phishing attempts and malicious redirects.
- Display historical lookup results if available.

3. **Quarantine Management**
- Securely isolate infected files.
- Allow users to restore or permanently delete quarantined files.
- Maintain detailed quarantine logs and history.

4. **Activity Monitoring**
- Log all scan activities, results, and user interactions.
- Monitor system health and performance metrics.
- Provide per-user scan history.

5. **Technical Stack**
- Backend: Python 3.8+ with Flask framework.
- ML Models: scikit-learn or TensorFlow/PyTorch for malware classification.
- Database: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite or PostgreSQL.
- Frontend: Use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, preferably with Bootstrap or React.
- APIs: Develop secure RESTful APIs for file and URL submission and retrieving results.
- Security: Implement data encryption (both in transit and at rest), secure file handling, input sanitization (to prevent XSS, file injection), and comply with GDPR/CCPA.

6. **Performance Targets**
- Scan response time under 30 seconds per file.
- Support at least 100 concurrent users.
- Maintain malware threat detection accuracy above 95%.

7. **User Interface**
- Responsive dashboard featuring:
  * Drag-and-drop file uploads.
  * URL submission form.
  * Real-time display of scan results with clear, color-coded risk indicators.
  * Tabs or sections for Scan History, Quarantine, and System Health monitoring.

8. **Security and Compliance**
- Encrypt sensitive data during storage and transmission.
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- Log all security-relevant events.
- Ensure the system meets GDPR and CCPA compliance standards.

9. **Stretch Goals for Optional Phase 2**
- Mobile-friendly frontend.
- Integration with cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).
- Behavioral analysis engine for advanced threat detection.
- Browser extension for real-time URL safety checks.

10. **Deliverables**
- Complete Flask backend integrated with ML models.
- Fully functional, responsive frontend interface.
- Comprehensive RESTful API with documentation.
- Unit and integration tests covering core functionality.
- Deployment-ready codebase, preferably containerized with Docker.

# Steps
- Architect the system based on the specified technical stack and requirements.
- Develop and train or integrate ML malware detection models.
- Create secure RESTful APIs handling file and URL submissions.
- Build the frontend dashboard with the described user experience and features.
- Implement quarantine and activity monitoring modules with secure data management.
- Ensure system security measures and compliance with regulations.
- Test the complete system for functionality, security, performance, and accuracy.
- Prepare deployment scripts and Docker configurations.

# Output Format
Provide a complete, well-structured project architecture and source code snippets or explanations demonstrating the implementation of each core component. Include API documentation details, test cases summaries, and deployment instructions. Highlight parts related to ML model integration and security compliance explicitly.

# Notes
- Emphasize reasoning steps and design considerations when choosing ML approaches.
- Ensure clear error handling and user feedback mechanisms in the frontend.
- Preserve modularity and scalability in the application design.
